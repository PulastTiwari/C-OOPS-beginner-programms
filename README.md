## 👨‍💻 Module 1: Introduction to Object Oriented Programming

📚 OOP treats data as a critical element in the program development and does not allow it to flow freely around the system.

📚 It ties more data closely to the functions that operate on it, and protects it from accidental modification from ooutside functions.

📚 It allows decomposition of a problem into a number of entities called objects and then builds data and functions around these objects.

### 💎 Features of OOP

📚 Emphasis is on data rather than procedure.

📚 Programs are divided into what are known as objects.

📚 Data structures are designed such that they characterise the objects.

📚 Data is hidden and cannot be accessed by external functions
