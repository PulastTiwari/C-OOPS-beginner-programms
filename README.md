## 👨‍💻 Module 1: Introduction to Object Oriented Programming

📚 OOP treats data as a critical element in the program development and does not allow it to flow freely around the system.

📚 It ties more data closely to the functions that operate on it, and protects it from accidental modification from ooutside functions.

📚 It allows decomposition of a problem into a number of entities called objects and then builds data and functions around these objects.

### 💎 Features of OOP

📚 Emphasis is on data rather than procedure.

📚 Programs are divided into what are known as objects.

📚 Data structures are designed such that they characterise the objects.

📚 Data is hidden and cannot be accessed by external functions.

📚 Objects may communicate with each other through functions.

📚 New data and functions can be easily added whenever necessary.

📚 Follows bottom-up approach in program design

### 📙 Basic concepts of OOP

📚 Objects

📚 Classes 

📚 Data abstraction and encapsulation

📚 Inheritance

📚 Polymorphism

📚 Dynamic Binding

📚 Message Passing

### 📙 Objects

📚 These are the basic run time entities in an object-oriented system. They may define as anything which is a group or collection.

📚 Programming problem is analysed in terms of objects and the nature of communication between them.

📚 Program objects should be chosen such that they match closely with the real-world objects.

📚 Object interacts by sending messages to one another.

### 📙 Classes

📚 The entire set of data and code of an object can be made a used-defined data type with the help of a class.

📚 Once a class has been defined, we can create any number of objects belonging to that class.

📚 They are user defined data types and behave like the built in types of a programming language.

📚 To define a class then the sytax statement is 

                                                ClassName ObjectName;

### 📙 Data Encapsulation 

📚 The wrapping up of data and fucntions into a single unit is known as encapsulation.

📚 Data is only accessible to the functions of the class and these functions provide the interface between the object's data and the program.

📚 The insulation of the data from direct access by the program is called data hiding.

### 📙 Data Abstraction

📚 It refers to the act of representing essential features without including the background details or explanations.

📚 They are list of attributes and functions to operate on these attributes.

📚 They encapsulate all the essential propeties of the objects that are to be created. The attributes are sometimes called data members.

📚 The functions that operates on data members are called member functions.

📚 Classes are also known as Abstract Data Types.

### 📙 Inheritance

📚 Inheritance is the process by which objects of one class acqire the properties of objects of another class.

📚 It supports the concepts of hierarchial classification.

📚 The priniciple behind division is that each derived class shares common characterstics with the class which it is derived.

📚 Here you can do reusability by deriving a new class from the existing one. This is a way to add additional features to an existing class without modifying it.

📚 Each sub-class defines only those features that are unique to it.

### 📙 Polymorphism

📚 It allows objects having different internal structures to share the same external interface. 

📚 General class of operations may be accessed in the same manner even though specific actions associated with each operation may differ.

📚 Polymorphism is used in implementing inheritance.

📚 Operator Overloading - The process of making an operator to exhibit different behaviours in different instances.

### 📙 Dynamic Binding

📚 Binding refers to the linking of a procedure call to the code to be executed in response to the call.

📚 Dynamic binding means that the code associated with a given proceduure call is not known until the time of the class at run-time.

📚 A function call associated with a polymorphic reference depends on the dynaamic type of that reference.

### 📙 Message Passing

📚 A message for an object is a request for execution of a procedure, and therefore will invoke a function in the receiving object that generates the desired result.

📚 Message passing invloves specifying the name of the object, the name of the function and the information to be sent.

                                                       Object.message(information);

### 📙 Benefits of OOP

📚 Through inheritance, we can eliminate redundant code and extend the use of existing classes.

📚 The priniciple of data hiding helps the programmer to build secure programs.

📚 It is possible to have multiple instances of an object to co-exist without any interference.

📚 It is possible to map objects in the problem domain to those in the program .

📚 It is easy to partition the work in a project based on objects.

📚 Software complexity can be easily managed.
